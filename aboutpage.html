       After the death of his girlfriend, Ian is feeling isolated and alone. 
       In order to fill the void, he takes up the habit of smoking.
       When at the smoke shop, he meets a mysterious man who claims he can bring his girlfriend back to him.
       The catch? He must smoke a strange, magical cigarette. 
       Ian does so and is shocked to see Avery return to him as a ghost. 
       Ian and Avery continue to go on many dates together, as they enjoy the second chance that they have been given. 
       The ability to see her again comes with a price however, as Ian is quickly dying as a result of the cigarettes. 
       In the end, Ian must learn to move on and accept that Avery is truly gone.
